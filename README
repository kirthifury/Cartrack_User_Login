Application for user login and see the list of users. On selecting a user the will launch
user info screen where you can see more details about user such as contact details, address,
email, website and company details.

As of now I haven't added user registration screen. So I have pre-populated the login database with
few sample credentials.

1. username: admin
   password: admin
   country: Singapore
2. username: guest
   password: guest
   country: Singapore
3. username: "cartrack"
   password: "password@123"
   country: "Singapore"
4. username: "devtest"
   password: "password1"
   country: "India"

On Login screen, country will get auto detected based on the device location. We can change it
by tapping on the country field.

On successful login, app user will be redirected to Users page. Here list of users is displayed.
The users list is maintained locally as json file and it is parsed while displaying the list of users.

Tapping on user will redirect to info screen where user's additional information is displayed.
When tapping on user address or location icon it will take us to map view where we can see the user's
location as marker in maps.

Maps api key added in local.properties for security reasons. Kindly add yours for testing.
Please feel free to reach out to me for any other clarifications.
